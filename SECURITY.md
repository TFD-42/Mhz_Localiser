# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in Mhz_Localise — for example, a vulnerability in the USB serial plugin, a way for a malicious Flipper-pretending device to crash or take control of the Android app, or an exploitable parser bug — please report it privately.

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
- Email the maintainers or use GitHub's *Report a vulnerability* feature on this repo.
- Include a description, reproduction steps, and (if possible) a minimal proof of concept.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a fix or mitigation timeline within 30 days for confirmed issues.

## Scope

In scope:

- The Flipper FAP (`Build/rf_logger/`) — memory safety, SD-card path handling.
- The Android Capacitor plugin (`Build/android_app/plugin/`) — USB intent handling, line parsing, permission flow.
- The web UI (`Build/android_app/www/`) — file import parser, exported data integrity.

Out of scope:

- General Flipper Zero firmware vulnerabilities (report upstream).
- Android OS or Capacitor framework vulnerabilities (report upstream).
- The accuracy or correctness of RSSI-based localisation — that is a documented limitation, not a security issue.
